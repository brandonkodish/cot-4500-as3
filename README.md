# cot-4500 Assignment 3

The only hard requirements are pip and python. I'm not sure how the other packages besides pip made it into the requirements file but they are not necessary and not used in my program. 

To run the code, run: 
```
python3 src/main/assignment_3.py
```

My answers were:

  Question 1: 1.224638
  
  Question 2: 1.2513
